# Interactive 3D Form-Making Environment for Architectural Education

## Project Overview
This project provides an immersive 3D form-making environment for architectural students using zSpace technology and Unity. It allows users to interact with 3D objects and create compositions that help visualize architectural concepts without needing physical materials.

## Getting Started
